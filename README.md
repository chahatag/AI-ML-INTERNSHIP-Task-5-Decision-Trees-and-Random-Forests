# AI-ML-INTERNSHIP-Task-5-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests

This project explores tree-based models for classification using Decision Trees and Random Forests. It uses the Iris dataset.

## Objective

* Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree.
* Analyze overfitting and control tree depth.
* Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy with the Decision Tree.
* Interpret feature importances from the Random Forest model.
* Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.

## Libraries Used

* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Graphviz**
